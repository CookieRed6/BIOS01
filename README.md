[**Neko8**](https://egordorichev.itch.io/neco8) is a **fantasy console**, inspired by [**pico8**](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [**liko12**](https://ramilego4game.itch.io/liko12) and [**tic80**](https://tic.computer/). It is open-source and fully free. Its goal is to be a fun and useful tool for game development and **especially for game jams**. 

Currently it features:

* Pico8-like api
* Code editor
* Sprite editor
* Map editor prototype
* Terminal
* Build-in API docs
* Some easter eggs ;)

Our developers can be found on [discord](https://discord.gg/DPBN8Xn).
